# Getting and Cleaning Data Project for peer review

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Data
The data for this project can be downloaded from: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Full description about the data can be found in:

## run_analysis.R
This script shows the R code used for cleaning the dataset. The code does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Cookbook.md
The codebook describes all the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
